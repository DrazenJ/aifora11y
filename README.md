# AI for A11y

This is a demo project used for the Frontmania talk of 2024 on the same subject by me

To make it work you will need a ChatGPT account with api keys set up in your .env:
**VITE_ORGANIZATION**=org-0103xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
**VITE_PROJECT**=proj_2RBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
**VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY**=sk-proj-dA9gkXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

After installing with `npm i` and setting the env variables run
```
npm run dev
npm run test
```
